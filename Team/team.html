            <h4 class = "team-member__course">Team Leader</h4>
            <p>Alya, one of the team leaders, is entering her final year of Nutrition BSc at King’s College London. After participating in iGEM 2020, she was inspired by iGEMs’ ability to empower young scientists and encourage participants to develop innovative solutions. This year she was motivated to work alongside her team to further develop last year’s work and lead her team into the final stages of their project design. After completing extensive research into spinal cord injuries during the iGEM season, Alya has been inspired to pursue a Masters in Neuroscience. She hopes to combine her knowledge in clinical nutrition to elucidate potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases. When she isn’t working on iGEM or her degree, Alya loves creative writing, binge-reading and working alongside the King’s Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology Society of which she is President.</p>

            <p>Luke, one of the team leaders, is entering his final year of Biochemistry BSc at King’s College London. Having loved his experience participating in iGEM 2020, he decided to take on the role of co-team leader this year. In his spare time, Luke does a lot of exercise, such as training in both Judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. He also spends a lot of time reading, both fiction and non-fiction, as it helps to keep his mind occupied outside of university. He has invested a lot of time in learning to speak Japanese, as he plans to travel there, to work in scientific research and design upon finishing his degree. He has a keen interest in immunology and the applications of genetic engineering tools including CRISPR-Cas9, and loves to dive into the mechanisms of cellular processes and the interactions that guide them. </p>

            <p>Aditya is currently in the third year of his Biochemistry BSc at King’s College London. He is fascinated by the multifaceted process of scientific research being translated into novel therapies or diagnostics produced by start-ups, with a particular interest in immunology. This component of the project spearheaded him to take part in iGEM, which fostered his entrepreneurial interests, but also led him to develop his competency in educational outreach and independent research in the field of synthetic biology. When he is not babbling about financial projections, he has a profound passion in sports such as Futsal, in which he co-founded a society at King’s, and Muay Thai. In the future, he would like to pursue a career in venture capital, and attributes this path to his experience at iGEM.</p>

            <p>Aini is currently in her third year of MBBS Medicine at King’s College London, which she balances alongside numerous event-planning roles in societies related to entrepreneurship , engineering and international relations. She is interested in exploring the ways in which these fields can interact - both directly and indirectly - with the healthcare landscape as a means of improving delivery of care beyond the patient bedside. This constitutes the main driver behind why she joined the KCL iGEM 2021 teams’ therapeutics-focused Phase II project, besides also wanting to build a strong foundation of research and general technical skills (e.g. animation on OpenToonz!). For sporting fixtures, Aini enjoys karate and badminton but would like to explore other martial arts and is an avid learner of modern foreign languages including French and Mandarin. In terms of clinical medicine, Aini’s current specialties of interest after completing the academic foundation year programme include obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics and anaesthesiology.</p>

            <p>kashdeep is currently in her final year of her Biomedical Science BSc at King’s College London, specialising in genetics and molecular biology. Her interest in regenerative medicine led her to join the iGEM team and she has been able to explore the real-world applications of regenerative medicine and synthetic biology for the development of therapeutic devices. She has also gained an insight into the various fields of biology such as science communication, education and entrepreneurship. In the future, she hopes to pursue a Masters degree related to stem cells and regenerative medicine. In her free time, she enjoys travelling, writing and watching Formula 1.</p>

            <p>Angela is in her second year of her Neuroscience BSc at King’s College London. She decided to join this year’s iGEM team as she was keen to explore the applications of synthetic biology in neuroscience and regenerative medicine. She is motivated to come up with ethical and responsible solutions to modern problems using Synthetic Biology, alongside her team members. During this iGEM season, she discovered her passion in science communication, with a focus on bridging the gap between researchers and the general public, using different engagement strategies. This summer she discovered her passions in design, coding, biobusiness, and particularly enjoyed having picnics with her iGEM family in the wild! In her non-iGEM (spare) time, she enjoys travelling, sports and music.</p>
