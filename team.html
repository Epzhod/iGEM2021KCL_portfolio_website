After participating in iGEM 2020, she was inspired by iGEMs’ ability to empower young scientists and encourage participants to develop innovative solutions. This year she was motivated to work alongside her team to further develop last year’s work and lead her team into the final stages of their project design. After completing extensive research into spinal cord injuries during the iGEM season, Alya has been inspired to pursue a Masters in Neuroscience. She hopes to combine her knowledge in clinical nutrition to elucidate potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases. When she isn’t working on iGEM or her degree, Alya loves creative writing, binge-reading and working alongside the King’s Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology Society of which she is President.</div>

In his spare time, Luke does a lot of exercise, such as training in both Judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. He also spends a lot of time reading, both fiction and non-fiction, as it helps to keep his mind occupied outside of university. He has invested a lot of time in learning to speak Japanese, as he plans to travel there, to work in scientific research and design upon finishing his degree. He has a keen interest in immunology and the applications of genetic engineering tools including CRISPR-Cas9, and loves to dive into the mechanisms of cellular processes and the interactions that guide them. </div>

He is fascinated by the multifaceted process of scientific research being translated into novel therapies or diagnostics produced by start-ups, with a particular interest in immunology. This component of the project spearheaded him to take part in iGEM, which fostered his entrepreneurial interests, but also led him to develop his competency in educational outreach and independent research in the field of synthetic biology. When he is not babbling about financial projections, he has a profound passion in sports such as Futsal, in which he co-founded a society at King’s, and Muay Thai. In the future, he would like to pursue a career in venture capital, and attributes this path to his experience at iGEM.</div>

Though doubtful at first whether iGEM, a synthetic biology competition, would help her attain expertise in her primary interest, the idea of independent, student-led research inspired her to participate. She subsequently found that many aspects of the project linked strongly to immunology, which even unearthed her passion for utilising immunology in therapeutics. She also attained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, video editing, audio mixing, vector design, science communication and essential teamwork skills. In the future, she hopes to undertake a Masters degree in immunology, aiming to implement her iGEM experience in fields such as vaccine development, cancer biology and gene therapy. In her spare time, she enjoys playing badminton, experimenting with music production and spending quality time with friends and family!</div>
