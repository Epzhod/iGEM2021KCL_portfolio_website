            <p>Alya, one of the team leaders, is entering her final year of Nutrition BSc at King’s College London. After participating in iGEM 2020, she was inspired by iGEMs’ ability to empower young scientists and encourage participants to develop innovative solutions. This year she was motivated to work alongside her team to further develop last year’s work and lead her team into the final stages of their project design. After completing extensive research into spinal cord injuries during the iGEM season, Alya has been inspired to pursue a Masters in Neuroscience. She hopes to combine her knowledge in clinical nutrition to elucidate potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative diseases. When she isn’t working on iGEM or her degree, Alya loves creative writing, binge-reading and working alongside the King’s Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology Society of which she is President.</p>

            <p>Luke, one of the team leaders, is entering his final year of Biochemistry BSc at King’s College London. Having loved his experience participating in iGEM 2020, he decided to take on the role of co-team leader this year. In his spare time, Luke does a lot of exercise, such as training in both Judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. He also spends a lot of time reading, both fiction and non-fiction, as it helps to keep his mind occupied outside of university. He has invested a lot of time in learning to speak Japanese, as he plans to travel there, to work in scientific research and design upon finishing his degree. He has a keen interest in immunology and the applications of genetic engineering tools including CRISPR-Cas9, and loves to dive into the mechanisms of cellular processes and the interactions that guide them. </p>

            <p>Aditya is currently in the third year of his Biochemistry BSc at King’s College London. He is fascinated by the multifaceted process of scientific research being translated into novel therapies or diagnostics produced by start-ups, with a particular interest in immunology. This component of the project spearheaded him to take part in iGEM, which fostered his entrepreneurial interests, but also led him to develop his competency in educational outreach and independent research in the field of synthetic biology. When he is not babbling about financial projections, he has a profound passion in sports such as Futsal, in which he co-founded a society at King’s, and Muay Thai. In the future, he would like to pursue a career in venture capital, and attributes this path to his experience at iGEM.</p>

            <p>Aini is currently in her third year of MBBS Medicine at King’s College London, which she balances alongside numerous event-planning roles in societies related to entrepreneurship , engineering and international relations. She is interested in exploring the ways in which these fields can interact - both directly and indirectly - with the healthcare landscape as a means of improving delivery of care beyond the patient bedside. This constitutes the main driver behind why she joined the KCL iGEM 2021 teams’ therapeutics-focused Phase II project, besides also wanting to build a strong foundation of research and general technical skills (e.g. animation on OpenToonz!). For sporting fixtures, Aini enjoys karate and badminton but would like to explore other martial arts and is an avid learner of modern foreign languages including French and Mandarin. In terms of clinical medicine, Aini’s current specialties of interest after completing the academic foundation year programme include obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics and anaesthesiology.</p>

            <p>Charity is going into her final year of Biomedical Science BSc at King’s College London, specialising in immunology. Though doubtful at first whether iGEM, a synthetic biology competition, would help her attain expertise in her primary interest, the idea of independent, student-led research inspired her to participate. She subsequently found that many aspects of the project linked strongly to immunology, which even unearthed her passion for utilising immunology in therapeutics. She also attained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, video editing, audio mixing, vector design, science communication and essential teamwork skills. In the future, she hopes to undertake a Masters degree in immunology, aiming to implement her iGEM experience in fields such as vaccine development, cancer biology and gene therapy. In her spare time, she enjoys playing badminton, experimenting with music production and spending quality time with friends and family!</p>

            <p> Finn has recently completed his BSc in Psychology at King’s College London and is aiming to successfully earn a place on a graduate scheme for management consultancy in 2022. Finn’s initial interest in iGEM stemmed from a desire to research topics with a greater neuroscientific and biotechnological focus than was within the scope of his degree. He was inspired to   apply problem solving skills to help develop a project and understand many of the concepts surrounding consultancy. Academically, Finn is primarily interested in novel neuromodulatory techniques, such as opto and chemogenetics, however, he is also an avid runner and collector of archive clothing.</p>

            <p> Kalyan is a second year student in molecular genetics at King's College London. Kalyan is passionate about the intersection of genes and disease, particularly looking into ways to treat major genetic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, cancer and cystic fibrosis. Additionally, he is interested in the ethical implications involved in synthetic biology and genetic research. Kalyan joined iGEM in 2021 due to a passion for novel scientific research and breakthroughs, wanting to see how a research project works from start to finish. Additionally, he saw this as an opportunity to look at how the medtech world functions and how a startup actually develops from the ground up. In the future, Kalyan sees himself working in groups dedicated to treating some of the major illnesses affecting the planet and working with communities to build robust healthcare strategies to address current medical problems.</p>

            <p> Milan has entered her final year studying Chemistry with Biomedicine BSc at King’s College London. Her main academic interest lies within medicinal chemistry and its applications in the pharmaceutical industry. She has always been fascinated by how different STEM subjects relate to each other, which is one of the reasons why she joined iGEM. Renervate Therapeutics gave her a taste of what independent research looks like, as she is considering pursuing a PhD. She believes in making her field of study more accessible to other students, so she dedicates her free time as editor of “The Catalyst”, a chemistry magazine she co-founded. She also loves to read classical and scientific books and her biggest inspiration is Marie Curie. </p>

            <p>Thurga is currently in her third year of Biomedical Engineering at King’s College London. Her interests are mainly in regenerative medicine and rehabilitation and she is hoping to pursue a Masters degree related to this field on completion of her undergraduate degree. She joined the iGEM team for the opportunity to work collaboratively in such a passionate, multidisciplinary team towards such an amazing goal. iGEM has further fuelled her fascination with synthetic biology and its many applications, while also allowing her to both apply and expand her skill set. When she is not studying or doing iGEM, Thurga is probably binge-watching a show, staying up late to read a whole book or trying to get her 3D printer to print something successfully. </p>
